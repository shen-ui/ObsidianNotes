# *Overview*

**A** query in itself is a functional statement which declares what data we are looking for. One can think of a table as a record of types (i.e. Shelf of Books, Drawer of Folders). All of these records of types are all of a single type sharing common properties.

The most basic query we can write would be one that selects for a couple properties (==columns==) of the table with all types (==rows==).

`SELECT property_one, property_two, ... , FROM Table;`
To get ALL rows of a table

`SELECT * FROM Table;`
This query is useful in being able to get an over view of the overall table and it's properties.
